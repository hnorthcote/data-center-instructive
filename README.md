# Data Center Basics

## Main idea

This app is a software implementation guide. Showing the basic software needed for deploying the solution to all users in a cost effective manner, taking in consideration the needs of the market vertical in play.

### How is it going to do this?

First it will identify what kind of vertical your company is working with we will start with: retail, health, education, government, financial and law. 

Then also we will take in consideration some basic information about the scale of the implementation.

## Results



The result of the query will be 3 main parts, the software that is recommended for this vertical. If the company is a large health organization, then using Epic or Cerner will be a must, or retail will need a back end CRM system. 

After setting the query parameters, the site will send out the recommended software, the needed hardware to run the software and the cost of all this.

It will be explained this is a basic frame for the needs of the operation and for further assistance we offer consulting services with a link for more information.

There will be an average cost associated to each  solution and a link to buy it.

## Ice Box

We will add other verticals such as marketing,  automotive, non-profit, media, transportation, etc. 

Refine and add more software solutions to customize the implementation.

Add appliances as hardware options.

Add HA capabilities.

Brake down cost of in house hardware purchase vs IaaS
